Class roster app created for Code Fellows' Foundations II class.

Instructions were as follows:

1) Create a Person class with a firstName and lastName property (String).
2) Create an optional property for an image (UIImage).
3) Create an initializer that takes in two parameters, a string for firstName and string for lastName
4) Create a fullName() function to return the Person's firstName and lastName as one String
5) Add a new method to your ViewController to initialize an Array of Person(s) with each person from class
6) Embed your View Controller in a Navigation Controller:
        from your Storyboard, click your yellow ViewController object
        click the Editor menu
        choose Embed In -> Navigation Controller
7) Create a button on your ViewController in Storyboard and connect it to another View Controller using a Show segue (previously known as push segue).

Advanced Challenge (not mandatory):

Using Apple's documentation as a guide, load in the array of Person objects from a .plist file in your bundle
